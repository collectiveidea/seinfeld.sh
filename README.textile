h1. seinfeld.sh

Inspired by Terminal outputting the last login date, seinfeld.sh shows the date of your last open source contribution as tracked by "Calendar About Nothing":http://calendaraboutnothing.com/.

h2. Setup

* "Authorize Calendar About Nothing":http://calendaraboutnothing.com/edit (if you haven't already).
* export your github username to the github_username variable
** @export github_username="bryckbost"@
** source the script so it gets called when you open terminal
